<H1 CLASS="western">Installation Instructions</H1>
<P CLASS="western">Download the latest installer from
<A HREF="http://www.clamwin.com/"></A><A HREF="http://www.clamwin.com/"></A><A HREF="http://www.clamwin.com/">www.clamwin.com</A><A HREF="http://www.clamwin.com/"></A><A HREF="http://www.clamwin.com/"></A>.
Close all running programs (especially Outlook and ClamWin), then
double-click on the downloaded file to run it. If you already have a
copy of ClamWin installed, you can upgrade it by simply running the
installer for a later version, and installing on top of the existing
version.</P>
<P CLASS="western">After clicking <U><B>N</B></U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><B>ext</B></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">
on the initial screen, the licence terms will be displayed. </SPAN></SPAN>This
program is released under the GNU General Public License. You must
agree to the terms of this licence to use this program. The
installation program will also install binary files from  Clam
Anti-Virus (<A HREF="http://www.clamav.net/"></A><A HREF="http://www.clamav.net/" NAME="Clam Anti-Virus home page" TARGET="_top"></A><A HREF="http://www.clamav.net/" NAME="Clam Anti-Virus home page">www.clamav.net</A><A HREF="http://www.clamav.net/" NAME="Clam Anti-Virus home page" TARGET="_top"></A><A HREF="http://www.clamav.net/"></A>),
which is also distributed under the GNU General Public License.</P>
<P CLASS="western">On the next screen the installer will ask you
whether you want to make ClamWin available to every user of the
computer, or just to yourself.  The recommended setting here is
&ldquo;Anyone who uses this computer&rdquo;.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Next, you will be asked where you would like
ClamWin to be installed. The default option is sensible, and you
should only change it if you have a particular reason to do so.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Next, you will be asked which parts of the program
to install.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Two selections (ClamAV Files and ClamWin Files)
are greyed out and cannot be de-selected. This is because these files
are essential for the program's correct operation. The other options
are as follows:</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Integration with Windows Explorer</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">:
If this option is selected, an extra option is added to Windows
Explorer's right-click menu, allowing files to be scanned quickly and
easily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Integration with Microsoft Outlook</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">:
If this option is selected, and if Microsoft Outlook is installed, an
Outlook add-in will be installed, which will check all incoming and
outgoing e-mails for viruses automatically. Note that t</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">his
option will only appear if Microsoft Outlook (not MS Outlook Express)
is installed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>International Help Files</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">:
This section has sub-sections for different languages. Although
ClamWin is not yet available in localised versions, members of the
community have provided translations of the help files and/or manual.
Selecting the relevant languages in this section will install these
translated help files/manuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">Next, you will be
asked which Start Menu folder ClamWin's icons should be placed in. By
default, a new folder named <B>ClamWin Antivirus</B> will be created,
and the icons placed in that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">The next screen asks
if you would like to download virus database files as soon as the
program is installed. It is a good idea to update the virus database
files as soon as possible. Note however that if you connect to the
internet using a proxy, you should first configure the proxy settings
before you can download the updates, so you will need to do this at a
later stage.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">This screen also gives
you the option to have a shortcut icon placed on the desktop.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: medium">The last screen
displays a summary of the options that have been selected. To install
ClamWin with the selected options, click <U><B>I</B></U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><B>nstall</B></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">.
To go back and change some options, click </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><B>&lt;
</B></SPAN><U><B>B</B></U><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><B>ack</B></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">If
you selected </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><B>Download
Virus Database Files</B></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">,
this will be done once the program is installed. You will need to be
connected to the Internet.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
